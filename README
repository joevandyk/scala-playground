# Add buildr and jruby to your path
export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/vendor/jruby/bin

# Start the webserver
buildr scala-playground:jetty

# Show all the possible tasks
buildr -T

# Run the tests
buildr test


STUFF LEFT TO DO

- 'buildr cc' will automatically recompile stuff upon code updates. 
  How can we get it to automatically run the tests as well?

- What's the best way to get hot code reloading -- where you update
  a file and Jetty automatically knows about it?

- What's the best / easiest way to deploy a Jetty webservice?  Ideally,
  all the Jars would be packaged up into a single file so the webserver
  only needs Java installed on it.  Then, how do we upgrade the app?

- Get the Scalatra service using the Scala classes we write.

- Get our Scalatra code under tests

- Get our code talking to a database.  I suppose sqlite is fine for now.
